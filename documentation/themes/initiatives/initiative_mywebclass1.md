# Initiative: Development of Interactive Learning Modules
## Description
This initiative aims to create interactive learning modules that leverage the MyWebClass platform, allowing students to gain practical experience in a hands-on learning environment. These modules will be designed to enhance the learning experience by providing students with realistic scenarios that contextualize technology and business processes. By using Agile project documentation, the initiative seeks to enable quick and effective development of the modules and set students up for long-term success.

## Goals:
* To enhance student engagement and motivation in the learning process
* To provide students with practical skills and knowledge that are applicable in real-world scenarios
* To improve student learning outcomes and academic performance

## Scope: 
The initiative will focus on the development of interactive learning modules that cover various topics and areas of study. The modules will be designed to provide a hands-on learning experience that simulates real-world scenarios.

## Outcomes:
* Increased student engagement and motivation in the learning process
* Improved student learning outcomes and academic performance
* Enhanced practical skills and knowledge that are applicable in real-world scenarios

## Deliverables:
* Interactive learning modules
* Simulation scenarios
* Assessment tools

## Milestones:
* Finalization and deployment of modules (1 month)
* Testing and feedback collection (2 months)
* Development of module prototypes (3 months)

## Constraints: 
Limited resources and funding may impact the scope and timeline of the initiative.

## Assumptions: 
Students have access to the necessary hardware and software to participate in the interactive learning modules.

## Risks:
* Technical issues may impact the functionality of the interactive learning modules
* Lack of student engagement may lead to poor learning outcomes

## Dependencies: 
The initiative is dependent on the availability of MyWebClass platform and its technical support team.
